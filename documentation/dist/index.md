# Distribution of `debug` apk

I have generated a `debug` apk by following the instructions from [this blog](https://medium.com/geekculture/react-native-generate-apk-debug-and-release-apk-4e9981a2ea51) and have shared it for further evaluation.

To generate a new `debug` apk, use the following commands that I have already added to the `package.json`.

```bash
$ npm run android:prebuild
```

```bash
$ npm run android:build
```
